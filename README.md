What are PUFFs?
----------------

PUFFs are the proprietary digital currency for The Leafy Cauldron Apothecary, 
that enables anonymous, instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. The
PUFFs blockchain will be used primarily as an immutable customer transaction 
ledger, and will be a "bridge" between other supported "420-friendly" crypto-
currencies accepted in-store, as well as with fiat purchases.

PUFFs uses the X11 PoW/Pos Hybrid cryptographic protocolspioneered by DASH to 
operate as a  distributed and secure payment system with an autonomous connection 
to the community, presenting a working business as the initial issuing central 
authority: with all further transactions management and currency issuance
are carried out collectively by the network thru "Proof of Work" mining and "Proof of
Stake" shareholder interest payments. The PUFFs currency is directly based off of
the Dash Core open source software platform which enables the use of this currency.
